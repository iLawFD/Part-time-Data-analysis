# In this rep, i will upload some of the tasks i was asked to do in my part time job. 
## 1 - Firt tasks:
     - clean all the data of all months files
     - create an excel file called stream c that contains the information off all the data in all months files in a given format
     - prepare the data in this file for anaylysis ( i helped a little bit also in the further anaylysis)
## 2 - procedural:
     - Read the motnhs file and apply straight fowrad pandas functions to clean the data
     - Create a new emtpy file in the desires format
     - Write a function that reads the data for each month file and then fills the output file with these data ( the logic is too complex to explain you can check it out in the notebook)
    

output:
